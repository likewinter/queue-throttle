# Laravel beanstalkd queue throttle

## Installing

### Laravel

    // Other Service Providers
    
    Likewinter\QueueThrottle\QueueThrottleServiceProvider::class
],
```

```

## Settings
You can set Redis and Beanstalkd hosts in your .env file like
```
BEANSTALKD_HOST=beanstalkd

```

## Using
Inside your Job class add trait and set limits
```php
use CanLimitRate;

protected $rateLimits = [
    ['requests' => 10, 'seconds' => 10],
    ['requests' => 15, 'seconds' => 30],
];
```
At the begining of ```handle()``` method use throttle
```php
$this->throttle();
```
